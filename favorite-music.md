# My Favorite Band #
> The Brian Jonestown Massacre (BJM for short) are a band formed in San Francisco, CA in 1990. Their music encompasses a wide variety of genres, including psychedelic rock, shoegaze, garage rock, folk rock, neo-psychedelia, blues rock and country rock. Anton Newcombe has been the only constant member since the bands founding. The BJM was once notorious for its internal drama between its members, causing many members to leave the band.

## Influences #
The BJM draws on a wide variety of influences. Their first two records, "Methodrone" "Spacegirl and other Favorites", draw influence from shoegaze bands such as:
* Galaxie 500
* Spacemen 3
* My Bloody Valentine

Their following records draw from bands that were integral to the rock and psychedelia scenes from the 1960's, such as:
* The Rolling Stones
* The Velvet Underground
* The Beatles
* Donovan
* Bob Dylan

Later BJM records signaled a return to their roots, with many of their albums returning to the shoegaze, goth and dream pop sound that had influenced them so heavily.
